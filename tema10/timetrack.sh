# Timetrack
#
# This is a script written for the course
# Linux as development environment. It is
# the solution to task 1f in Tema 10.
#
# The script takes a command as input, and
# can handle the commands start, stop and
# status
# start  - Starts a counter
# stop   - Stops the counter and outputs the
#          time passed since started
# status - If the timer is started it outputs
#          the time passed since started.


# Get the command
command=$1

# Support function to print the time since
# timer was started
function outputTime {
  old_sec=`cat timetrack.txt`
  new_sec=`date +%s`
  sec=$(($new_sec-$old_sec))
  echo -n $sec
}

case "$command" in
